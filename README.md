# Google DA Cert Capstone - Case Study 1

## Work with Spreadsheet
### Microsoft Word
Due to the lack of Microsoft Office subscription, I wanted to access Excel through my K-State school account. I was not able to upload any of the data files (e.g. from "2024-01-divvy-tripdata" to "2024-12-divvy-tripdata").
### Google Sheets
I was able to upload the first 2 files of data files (i.e. "2024-01-divvy-tripdata" and "2024-02-divvy-tripdata"). For each of these data files, I have made pivot tables and associated charts.

## Work with SQL
### Background
As shown in the certificate, I used Google's BigQuery to write and execute SQL queries. After getting the sandbox account, I was able to upload only the first four data files at its orginal size (e.g. "2024-01-divvy-tripdata" to "2024-04-divvy-tripdata"). Because of the 100 MB size restriction for uploading each data file, I had to compress some csv data files (e.g. "2024-05-divvy-tripdata" to "2024-10-divvy-tripdata") using an online tool: https://www.chatdb.ai/tools/csv-compressor. Then, I uploaded the data files into BigQuery.
### Queries
1. The first query finds the average trip duration by membership type (e.g. casual, member) and day of week. SQL code: ''
